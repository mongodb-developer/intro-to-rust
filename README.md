# Rust Workshop

## This Repo

This repository contains code for a intro to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and to microservices written in Rust. You'll find code to create a simple model for [Tasks](src/task.rs) and a [Repository](src/in_memory_task_repo.rs) to store/read these Tasks

## How to use it

Each commit in this repo is a new step towards the building of the final example. Clone this repo and checkout the initial commit. Then just read [each commit description](commits/main) and look at the changes.
